Thank you to visit this link. We provide the BNF grammar and coding for HTDL (Hierarchical Task Description Language). Please click the attached file in turn, and then click the "Download file" button in the upper right corner of the page to download the files. (you may see garbled code, but it won't make a difference.) 
All documents are anonymized for the reviewers, and we commit to excluding any information that could identify the authors.
You may also see a false alarm "The requested file is not found", but you can still download it for review.
